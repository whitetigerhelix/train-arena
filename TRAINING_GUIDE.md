# TrainArena Training Process - Clarified

## ðŸŽ¯ **What Happens During "Sanity Check" (Play Mode)**

### **Autonomous Behavior (Not Manual Control)**

- **Behavior Type**: Set to `Default` - agents act autonomously using random actions initially
- **No WASD Control**: Agents learn to move themselves, not controlled by player
- **Rolling Physics**: Agents learning realistic physics-based movement (this is CORRECT behavior)

### **Expected Visuals**

- **Blue cubes with white eyes** = CubeAgents (eyes show forward direction)
- **Yellow spheres** = Goals (now properly distributed, not stacked)
- **Red cubes** = Obstacles (block agent paths)
- **Gray platforms** = Ground (properly sized, agents won't fall off)

### **Expected Behavior**

1. **Random Movement**: Untrained agents move randomly at first
2. **Goal-Seeking**: Agents should gradually orient toward yellow goals
3. **Obstacle Avoidance**: Agents get penalties for hitting red obstacles
4. **Episode Reset**: When agent reaches goal, scene resets with new positions
5. **Physics-Based**: Agents "roll" and "tumble" - this is realistic learning!

## ðŸš‚ **Training Process (mlagents-learn)**

### **Parallel Training (All Agents Learn Together)**

- **16 Environments**: 4x4 grid of arenas train simultaneously
- **NOT Sequential**: All 16 agents contribute experience at the same time
- **Shared Brain**: All agents use the same neural network policy
- **Collective Learning**: Experiences from all agents improve the single model

### **Training Command**

```bash
mlagents-learn Assets/ML-Agents/Configs/cube_ppo.yaml --run-id=cube --train
```

### **What Each Agent Contributes**

- **Observations**: Local velocity, direction to goal, obstacle distances (8 raycasts)
- **Actions**: 2D movement force applied to cube
- **Rewards**:
  - Progress toward goal (+)
  - Time penalty (-)
  - Energy penalty (-)
  - Obstacle collision (-)
  - Goal reached bonus (+1.0)

### **Learning Timeline**

- **Episode 0-1000**: Random movement, occasional goal reaches
- **Episode 1000-5000**: Basic goal-seeking behavior emerges
- **Episode 5000-10000**: Obstacle avoidance develops
- **Episode 10000+**: Efficient pathfinding and smooth movement

## ðŸ”§ **Recent Fixes Applied**

### **1. Goal Distribution**

- **Before**: Goals stacked on top of each other
- **After**: Goals distributed using angular offset pattern (no more stacking)

### **2. Agent Identification**

- **Added**: White "eyes" on front of blue cubes show orientation
- **Purpose**: Easy to see which direction agents are "looking"

### **3. Autonomous Behavior**

- **Removed**: WASD manual control (was for debugging only)
- **Set**: `BehaviorType.Default` for proper ML-Agents training

### **4. Physics Movement**

- **Clarified**: "Rolling" movement is CORRECT - agents learn realistic physics
- **Not a Bug**: Smooth interpolation would be unrealistic for cube physics

## ðŸ“Š **Success Metrics**

### **Sanity Check Success**

- âœ… Agents stay on platforms (no falling)
- âœ… Goals distributed across arenas (no stacking)
- âœ… Agents show some goal-directed movement
- âœ… Episodes reset when goals reached
- âœ… No error spam in console

### **Training Success**

- **Early**: 10-20% goal reach rate
- **Mid**: 60-80% goal reach rate
- **Late**: 90%+ goal reach rate with efficient paths
