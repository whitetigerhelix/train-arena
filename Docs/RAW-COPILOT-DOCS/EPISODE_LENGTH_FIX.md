# 🎮 Arena Configuration & Episode Length Guide

## 📊 **Fixed: Episode Length Problem**

### **Previous Issue:**

- **Episodes**: 100 steps (10 seconds) - WAY too short!
- **Result**: Agents reset before they could navigate to goals
- **Problem**: No visible learning or goal-seeking behavior

### **New Settings:**

- **Episodes**: 1000 steps (60 seconds) - Proper navigation time!
- **Result**: Agents can visibly move toward goals and learn
- **Config**: `time_horizon: 1000` matches episode length

## 🏗️ **New: Configurable Arena Layouts**

### **EnvInitializer Presets:**

1. **SingleArena** 🎯

   - **Grid**: 1x1 (1 arena)
   - **Use for**: Model testing, debugging, watching individual agent behavior
   - **Obstacles**: 3 (reduced for cleaner testing)

2. **Training** 🏋️

   - **Grid**: 4x4 (16 arenas)
   - **Use for**: Standard training sessions
   - **Obstacles**: 6 (balanced challenge)

3. **LargeTraining** 💪

   - **Grid**: 6x6 (36 arenas)
   - **Use for**: Intensive training, faster learning
   - **Obstacles**: 8 (more challenging)

4. **Custom** ⚙️
   - **Manual settings** in inspector
   - **Use for**: Specific experiments

## 🚀 **How to Use New System**

### **For Testing Your Trained Model:**

1. **Open CubeTrainingScene**
2. **Set EnvInitializer preset** to `SingleArena`
3. **Load your .onnx model** into one CubeAgent
4. **Set Behavior Type** to `Inference Only`
5. **Press Play** - watch agent navigate for full 60 seconds!

### **For New Training:**

1. **Set EnvInitializer preset** to `Training` (4x4)
2. **Ensure all agents** have Behavior Type `Default`
3. **Run training script** - episodes now last long enough for proper learning!

### **Expected Behavior Now:**

✅ **Agents move for 30-60 seconds** before episode reset  
✅ **Visible navigation** toward green goals  
✅ **Clear success/failure** outcomes  
✅ **Proper learning time** for decision making

## ⚡ **Performance Notes**

### **Episode Length Impact:**

- **Training time**: Longer (but more effective learning)
- **Unity stability**: Should be fine with proper episode management
- **Learning quality**: Much better - agents have time to explore and learn

### **Arena Count Impact:**

- **1 Arena**: Slower training, better for observation
- **16 Arenas**: Balanced training speed and performance
- **36 Arenas**: Faster training, higher system load

### **Memory Management:**

- **Garbage collection**: Still runs every 50 episodes
- **Episode tracking**: Global counter across all agents
- **Unity hanging**: Should be resolved with proper episode completion

## 🔧 **Next Steps**

1. **Test your existing model** with SingleArena preset
2. **If model performs poorly**, retrain with new 1000-step episodes
3. **Compare performance** between old ultra-short and new proper-length training
4. **Use different arena presets** for different purposes

**The new 60-second episodes should give you much more realistic and observable agent behavior!** 🎯
