# 1-Week Plan & Copilot Grounding (Unity + ML-Agents)

Use this document to drive GitHub Copilot / tasks. Keep commits small and runnable.

## üéØ Current Status (Sept 15, 2025)
**Phase:** Day 1 - Scene Building COMPLETE ‚úÖ, Ready for PPO Training üöÄ

**What's Working:**
- ‚úÖ Unity 6.2 with ML-Agents package
- ‚úÖ CubeAgent with 14 observations (velocity + goal + 8 raycasts) + 2 continuous actions
- ‚úÖ 16-arena training environment with programmatic scene generation
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive debug system with keyboard controls (R/I/O/V/A/H)
- ‚úÖ Proper BehaviorParameters configuration (eliminates console warnings)
- ‚úÖ Physics-based movement with reward system

**Next Steps:**
1. Switch BehaviorType from "Heuristic Only" to "Default" 
2. Run training command: `mlagents-learn Assets/ML-Agents/Configs/cube_ppo.yaml --run-id=cube_run_01 --train`
3. Monitor with TensorBoard

---

## Goals
1. **Learn PPO in practice** with Unity ML-Agents
2. Ship a **cool demo**: Cube ‚Üí Ragdoll ‚Üí Mini-Game (tag/obstacles)
3. Export **ONNX** and run **inference-only** in-engine

## Day-by-Day Schedule

### Day 1 ‚Äì Boot & Baseline (Cube)
- [x] Create Unity project, add ML-Agents + Barracuda
- [x] Add `CubeAgent`, `EnvInitializer`, and scene builder menu
- [x] Run a few env instances in play mode (16 arenas implemented)
- [ ] Train PPO with `cube_ppo.yaml` ‚Üê **NEXT STEP**
- Deliverable: short clip of early learning + TensorBoard plot

### Day 2 ‚Äì Game-ify Cube
- [ ] Add curriculum (goal distance ‚Üë, obstacle count ‚Üë)
- [ ] Add moving hazards + raycast sensor debug gizmos
- [ ] Headless/fast training setup (timeScale, vsync off)
- Deliverable: trained model beating heuristic baseline

### Day 3 ‚Äì Ragdoll Prototype
- [ ] Build ragdoll with joints + PD controllers
- [ ] `RagdollAgent` obs/actions/rewards skeleton
- [ ] Stand and slow forward locomotion
- Deliverable: ragdoll stands & shuffles forward

### Day 4 ‚Äì Walk
- [ ] Tune PD gains; reward shaping (uprightness, speed, energy)
- [ ] Domain randomization (mass/friction)
- [ ] Add perturbation pushes to test robustness
- Deliverable: stable forward walk for 10+ s

### Day 5 ‚Äì Objective Layer
- [ ] Simple tag or capture-the-flag (single agent vs. moving target)
- [ ] Add UI toggles for hazards, target speed
- Deliverable: fun arena scene

### Day 6 ‚Äì Inference & Polish
- [ ] Export ONNX, set Behavior to Inference Only
- [ ] Add model switcher (Random/Heuristic/Trained)
- [ ] Add in-game reward bars
- Deliverable: 120 FPS playable demo

### Day 7 ‚Äì Package & Share
- [ ] Record sizzle reel + GIFs
- [ ] One-pager of PPO settings & lessons learned
- [ ] Clean repo, write final README

## Technical Tasks (Copilot-friendly)

### A. Cube Agent
- [x] Implement `CollectObservations`: local vel, vector-to-goal, 8 raycasts (14 total observations)
- [x] Implement `OnActionReceived`: apply local force, time & energy penalties
- [x] Implement goal success / obstacle penalties
- [x] Add `Heuristic` for WASD (+ random actions for testing)
- [x] Add `EnvInitializer` to spawn N arenas laid out in a grid (4x4 = 16 arenas)

### B. Ragdoll
- [ ] Build joint hierarchy; add `PDJointController` per joint
- [ ] In `RagdollAgent`, expose list of joints; obs = angles, angVels, pelvis vel/orient
- [ ] Actions = target joint angles ([-1,1] mapped to joint limits)
- [ ] Rewards = forward speed, uprightness (dot(up, bodyUp)), energy, lateral drift
- [ ] EndEpisode on fall (pelvis height low or tilt > threshold)

### C. Training/Infra
- [x] Provide PPO YAMLs (cube & ragdoll) - `cube_ppo.yaml` ready
- [ ] Add shell/PowerShell scripts to launch training ‚Üê **TODO: Next**
- [ ] Add TensorBoard instructions
- [ ] Add `Results/` to .gitignore

### D. Demo Polish
- [ ] Simple UI Canvas: speed slider, hazard toggle, model switcher dropdown
- [ ] Domain randomization toggle
- [ ] Reward bar graph during play
- [ ] Side-by-side heuristic vs trained agents

## PPO Defaults (starting points)
- hidden_units: 128
- num_layers: 2
- gamma: 0.99
- gae lambda: 0.95
- clip: 0.2
- entropy: 0.003‚Äì0.01
- learning_rate: 3e-4
- batch_size: 1024‚Äì4096
- time_horizon: 128‚Äì256
- num_epoch: 3‚Äì5

---

## Definition of Done (per stage)
- **Cube**: reaches random goals w/ obstacles in under 30s sim time
- **Ragdoll**: walks 10 m without falling; generalizes to minor friction/mass changes
- **Mini-Game**: runner avoids tagger for ‚â• 10 s reliably

---

## Risks & Mitigations
- Slow learning ‚Üí increase env instances, entropy, simplify reward, add curriculum
- Ragdoll instability ‚Üí PD gains, clip actions, lower max torques, bigger feet, start with stand task
- Demo performance ‚Üí inference-only, disable expensive graphics, fixed timestep tuning
