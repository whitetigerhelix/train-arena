# 🚀 Performance Optimization & Movement Debugging

## ⚡ **Performance Issues Fixed:**

### **Problem:** Unity choppy, 337s timeout, agents not moving

### **Solutions Applied:**

1. **📉 Reduced Arena Grid:**

   - **Training preset**: 4x4 → **3x3** (16 → 9 arenas)
   - **Obstacles per arena**: 6 → **4** (reduced computational load)
   - **Total reduction**: ~44% fewer objects to simulate

2. **⏱️ Balanced Episode Length:**

   - **Steps**: 1000 → **500** (still 5x longer than original 100!)
   - **Time**: 60s → **30s** (still 3x longer than original 10s)
   - **Balance**: Visible navigation + better performance

3. **🔍 Enhanced Movement Debugging:**
   - **Action counter**: Track if agents receive non-zero actions
   - **More frequent logging**: Every 15s (was 60s) for debugging
   - **Velocity tracking**: Monitor if forces are actually applied

## 🐛 **Movement Debugging Features Added:**

### **Action Tracking:**

```csharp
// Count non-zero actions received
totalActionsReceived++; // When |moveX| > 0.01 or |moveZ| > 0.01

// Reset each episode
totalActionsReceived = 0; // OnEpisodeBegin()
```

### **Enhanced Status Logging:**

```
🤖 CubeAgent_Arena_1: STUCK | Default | Vel=0.02 | Goal=4.5 | Actions=127 | Step=45/500
```

**What to Look For:**

- **Actions > 0**: Agent receiving ML-Agents commands ✅
- **Actions = 0**: No ML-Agents connection ❌
- **Vel > 0.1**: Forces being applied properly ✅
- **Vel ≈ 0**: Physics or force issues ❌

## 🔧 **Performance Settings Summary:**

### **Arena Configuration (3x3):**

- **Total Agents**: 9 (was 16)
- **Total Objects**: ~45 (was ~80)
- **Memory Load**: Significantly reduced
- **Unity Performance**: Should be much smoother

### **Episode Settings (Balanced):**

- **Max Steps**: 500 (visible navigation time)
- **Time Limit**: 30s (reasonable goal-seeking time)
- **Timeout Behavior**: Proper episode completion
- **Performance**: Much better than 1000 steps

### **Logging Frequency:**

- **Action logs**: Every 10s (when actions > 0.1)
- **Status logs**: Every 15s (with action count)
- **Performance**: Minimal logging overhead

---

## 🎯 **Expected Results:**

### **Unity Performance:**

- ✅ **Smoother playback** (fewer objects)
- ✅ **No timeout** (better episode management)
- ✅ **Stable framerate** (optimized logging)

### **Agent Behavior:**

- ✅ **Visible movement** toward goals
- ✅ **30-second navigation** episodes
- ✅ **Clear success/failure** outcomes

### **Training Quality:**

- ✅ **Proper learning time** (500 steps)
- ✅ **Balanced performance** vs learning
- ✅ **Faster iterations** (9 vs 16 agents)

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting Movement Issues:**

### **If agents still don't move:**

1. **Check Action Count** in logs:

   - `Actions=0` → ML-Agents connection problem
   - `Actions>0` but `Vel=0` → Physics/force issue

2. **Verify Training Connection:**

   - PowerShell script connecting properly?
   - Unity showing "Connected to Trainer"?
   - AutoBehaviorSwitcher working?

3. **Physics Debug:**

   - Check `moveAccel = 10f` in inspector
   - Verify Rigidbody mass (should be 1)
   - Check for physics constraints

4. **Behavior Type Check:**
   - Should be "Default" for training
   - "HeuristicOnly" for manual testing (WASD)
   - "InferenceOnly" for trained model testing

---

## 🎲 **Testing Steps:**

1. **Run new 3x3 training** and monitor console
2. **Look for action counts** in status logs
3. **Watch for velocity values** > 0.1
4. **Check Unity smoothness** (no choppiness)
5. **Verify episode completion** after ~30s

The 3x3 grid should provide **much better performance** while maintaining effective training! 🚀
